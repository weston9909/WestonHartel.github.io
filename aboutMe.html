            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            
            <p>When I discovered computer science as a high-schooler, it was a fun way to explore logical problems and to make fun little games. I have always loved to create, whether it was through painting, woodworking, building lego creations, or now writing software, the concept of coming up with an idea in my head and bringing it into the world with my own two hands has always been a concept that exited me to my core. Playing video games growing up, I was exited by the prospect to create games myself. I took my first coding class in my junior year of high school, and had my first introduction to programming. I spent months making my first game, which was a simple action game where you maneuver around obstacles. I've been a bit of a perfectionist as long as I can remember, so the process of writing code, running it, receiving feedback, and then improving the code was a work cycle I was naturally very fond of. By the time I had completed the game, I had noticed three things; That was the hardest I had ever worked on a project, the work was so interesting and fun that long hours in the computer lab didn't feel like working, and that I had acquired a newfound pride in my work. Chasing these three core feelings carried me through my first years as a computer scientist. I soon discovered however, that programming could be used for a lot more than just games, that it was a tool that could give one person the power to do the work of very many if used correctly, and my eyes were opened to the vast possibilities of this new world. </p>
                
            <p>After graduating high school mid-pandemic in 2020, I went to Boise State University to pursue a degree in Computer Science. As I delved deeper into my computer science studies, my drive to innovate came to the forefront. I started believing that I could acquire the skills to actually bring some of my big picture ideas to life, and thus started writing them down in a journal. Throughout the next years I was brimming with ideas for products and businesses with the potential to contribute positively to society. Computer science had been the key to transforming these concepts into tangible realities, empowering me to shape my visions with my own hands. My only problem if that it was a big jump from creating personal projects, to writing professional grade code and designing applications from the ground up. Boise had been great for learning the fundementals, getting lots of practice, and learning from professors with real experience, but I decided that in order to bring my dreams fully into reality, I had to take my studies to the next level. I throughly enjoyed my time in Idaho, and will forever be grateful for the experience I had there, as well as the lifelong friends I made along the way. My Junior year I was accepted to Chapman University in southern California as a transfer student. Chapman had a relatively new program for CS, but the rigor was definitely there. With the resources to hire professors that had worked at industry leaders such as Apple, Boing, NASA, as well as a great network for internships, this was truly a haven for the study of computer science. This allowed my to start my two biggest projects to Date, 'Project Parlay' - an AI for live sports betting Analysis, and 'RSS-Algotrader' - a bot that places trades algorithmicly on the stock market (Has achieved 350% Portfolio Growth in 7 Months). Both of these projects are multi-year endeavors with real profit incentives behind them, giving me the opportunity to lead teams of developers I recruited to work with along the way, and produce top-notch, professional quality, shippable products. With both timelines set for completion within the year, things are getting exiting! I am currently a Senior at Chapman University pursuing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, and I am eternally thankful for the growth my rich and varied academic journey has allowed me. â€”</p>
                
            <p>My academic journey has been complemented by practical experience gained through an internship within the industry, where I applied my theoretical knowledge learned in the classroom alongside experienced engineers. I was grateful to be employed by Appdetex during my time in Boise, Idaho. This opportunity not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for collaborative problem-solving. I did a variety of tasks within the company, some of which included assisting senior developers In bug tracking, proficient with Hadoop, AWS, working in an Agile Development environment, managing and analyzing data in a large SQL database, web crawling and scraping using web automation tools (Puppeteer, Cypress), experience using github, the peer code review process, and unit testing with a professional
            development team. I am also now proficient in 11 programming languages and have a proven ability to quickly adapt to new technologies.</p>
                
            <p>My foray into the professional sphere has taught me that learning is a multifaceted process, and I apply this understanding to my role as a tutor, ensuring I adapt to each student's unique learning style. The areas that spark my enthusiasm most include sports analytics, probability theory, and algorithmic strategies for financial investments. As I continue to grow in my early career, I am constantly on the lookout for opportunities to expand my technical skill set and embrace new challenges.</p>
