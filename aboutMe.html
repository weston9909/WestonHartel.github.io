                <h2>Bio:</h2>
                
                <p>My name is Weston Hartel.  I am a Senior at Newport Harbor High School, class of 2025. I am a Right-Handed Attacker, stand 6’1” tall and weigh 180 lbs. I have challenged myself with several AP/ IB classes, have a 4.0 (w) GPA and am a two time USA Water Polo Academic All-American.  This summer I helped my club team, Newport Beach Water Polo, become 2024 18U Futures Super Final Champions and 2024 18U Junior Olympic Platinum Division Champions. </p>
                    
                <p>I have played with Newport Beach Water Polo Club since I was 9 years old, and many of my teammates and I have shared a strong bond for over 9 years.  This deep camaraderie is something I seek in a college team. What makes Newport Harbor Water Polo so special is that we are a public school where local kids have achieved extraordinary results through hard work and dedication. Being coached by Ross Sinclair is like taking AP Water Polo.  With Coach Ross’s intense training, I have developed a strong work ethic and excellent time management skills; successfully balancing AP classes, 5 hours of water polo daily and part-time work during holidays.  —</p>
                    
                <p>While playing strong defense, my strength lies in having great vision and providing opportunities for my teammates.  I excel in directing the offense, setting up plays, moving the ball, making key passes to center, posting up, and being a scoring threat.  This past year our “homegrown” image has changed in that we have had 5 national team players transfer from private schools to Newport Harbor. This heightened competition for playtime has driven me to work even harder and persevere through challenges, making me well prepared to succeed and contribute effectively at the collegiate level.</p>
                    
                <p>In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, surfing, going to the beach, snowboarding, playing video games, weightlifting, traveling and spending time with my family.  I like being involved in my community and have done over 50 hours of community service with Lion’s Heart during high school. I regularly participate in beach cleanups and have volunteered multiple times for Epic Days at Newport Dunes, a water day for kids with special needs.  I love playing water polo and my goal is to continue playing in college at the highest level possible.</p>
