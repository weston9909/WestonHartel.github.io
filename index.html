                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>As a high-schooler, I found joy in using computer science to tackle logical problems and create games, fueling my lifelong passion for turning imaginative ideas into reality. My academic path has led to Boise State University and Chapman University in computer science, complementing an internship in industry, and honing my ability to bring ambitious projects to life. I've led significant initiatives, like 'Project Parlay', 'RSS-Algotrader,' and many more projects. This has given me experience blending innovation and creativity with profit motives and real deadlines, as well as leading to proficiency in 11 programming languages. I continually seek to grow and embrace new technical challenges.

                <p>
                    I am currently a Senior pursing a B.S. in Computer Science at Chapman University with a minor in Mathmatics. In the future, I am considering expanding my education to a full B.S. in Math as well, but am also very exited to get into the industry and begin working. I am on track to graduate in 2025, to see a full course list, or other skills I have aquired along the way, please navigate to the 'Education' Page!

        <h2>Tutoring Services</h2>
        <p>Growing up with 2 younger brothers, I have a lifetime of experience in passing down important skills to my younger peers. My goal is to help every student understand the "Bigger Picture" behind what they are doing, and teach them how to think through problems in a way that makes the material easy to understand, intuitive, and something they can confidently build on in the future. Students will leave my sessions not just memorizing formulas or methods, but with an understanding of WHY what they are doing. I believe that in order to do your best work you must enjoy what you are doing, so I aim to inspire students by showing them what can make math and science fun, powerful tools that can be used in everyday life. I can tutor at any level up to and below Sophomore at University.</p>
